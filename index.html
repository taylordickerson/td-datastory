      <p class="header">This is the Data Story from Spring 2018, tracking how we use media
        in our day-to-day use.</p>

    <p id="intro">Throughout the semester, our class has studied the way we use data. Data
      is most often thought to be &quot;big data&quot;, but this class has helped
      me see that anything can be collected and studied to provide insight into
      a larger whole. Our projects were modeled after the &quot;Dear Data&quot;
      project, and through Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec's correspondence, I
      learned that not all data collection had to be so rigid and mechanical. Through
      their visual designs, I came to appreciate more of the human side of data.

        <br>
        <p>For the data collection project, I tracked my mood with what emojis
          I sent in my messages. I tracked my messages over my phone's messaging
          app, Twitter, Line (a messaging app), and email. This project made me
          more aware of my emoji use and how I use them to illustrate certain
          moods. One drawback in the assignment was that I was aware of my
          behavior which may have influenced my use of emojis over the week, but
          I know this wasn't exactly a detractor to this particular
          assignment.</p></div>

        <br>
        <p>We then used the results from our Data Collection to create our Data
        Visualization. For this assignment, we had to pick a narrative that we wanted to tell
        through our Visualization. For mine, I chose to represent my data through
        a chord diagram. Moods are abstract, so I centered them in my graph and
        with different weighted lines, I connected the emojis to those moods.</p></div>

        <br>
        <p>For my Explained Video, I decided to focus on the development of
          emojis. Since my previous projects centered around emojis, I wanted to
          explore exactly who is in charge of the process and some of the controversies
          that have arisen because of emojis. I made the video using iMovie with
          clips and pictures from Pixabay and from screen-grabs that I made
          myself. Researching emojis gave me greater understanding how companies
          create them.</p></div>
